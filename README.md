# Customer-Support-System


**Ikigai Customer Support System** 
Design and implement a customer support system for Ikigai, a service-based company. Ikigai, a 
service-based company, needs a customer support system to manage incoming customer 
inquiries, complaints, and requests in an organized and efficient manner. The system should 
ensure that customer’s issues are addressed. Additionally, the system should have a searching 
functionality to find and display support tickets based on specific criteria, such as customer name, 
ticket ID or issue type.  Each customer support ticket should include the following details: 
ticket ID, customer name, contact information, issue type, issue description, timestamp 
and progress status (a New progress status is assigned to every newly issued ticket).   
The system should allow users to perform the following functions: 
a) Add a new customer support ticket to the waiting queue and assign a Ticket ID. 
b) Process the next customer support ticket and remove it from the waiting queue once 
it has been solved.  
c) View the details of the next customer support ticket in the queue without removing it 
from the list. 
d) Check if the customer support ticket list is empty or display the list of tickets that have 
been solved and those that have not been solved. 
e) Search for customer support ticket(s) based on specific criteria (e.g., ticket ID, 
customer name, issue type, etc.). 
f) Generate a weekly summary report and sort it based on unresolved customer 
support tickets sorted by issue type and total number of tickets for each issue type. 
The system should also display the percentage of unresolved tickets.
